# AI-Enabled Smart Fence with Edge Processing, Blockchain Security & Drone Deployment

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an **AI-enabled Smart Fence system** designed for **real-time perimeter intrusion detection** using **edge AI**, **multi-sensor fusion**, **blockchain-secured event logging**, and **autonomous drone deployment**.

The system overcomes limitations of traditional surveillance by performing **on-device intelligence**, ensuring **low latency**, **high accuracy**, and **operational independence** even in **GPS-denied or internet-free environments**.

## 🎯 Key Features
- ✅ Multi-sensor intrusion detection (Thermal, Infrared, Vibration, Motion)
- ✅ Edge AI-based real-time classification (95%+ accuracy)
- ✅ Multi-layer intrusion validation to reduce false alarms
- ✅ Blockchain-secured, tamper-proof event logging
- ✅ Autonomous drone deployment for aerial surveillance
- ✅ Secure, multi-channel alerting system
- ✅ Works without internet or cloud dependency
